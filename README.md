## Features Overview

### 1. Search Algorithms

#### Linear Search (Sequential Search)
- **Description:** Iterates through the array element by element until the target value is found.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Visualization:**
- Highlights each element visited during the search.
- Permanently highlights the found element.

**Interaction:**
- Users define the number of elements and their values.
- Input the target value to search.
- Observe real-time progress through visual animations.

#### Binary Search
- **Description:** Works on sorted arrays, dividing the array into halves to locate the target value.
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Visualization:**
- Highlights the current search range and the middle element at each step.
- Shows how the range narrows progressively.

**Interaction:**
- Users define the number of elements and their values.
- Select the value to search.
- Watch each step of the search through an animated display.

### 2. Sorting Algorithms

#### Bubble Sort
- **Description:** Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Visualization:**
- Highlights elements being compared.
- Animates swaps to show each step clearly.

#### Selection Sort
- **Description:** Selects the minimum element in each iteration and places it in its correct position.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Visualization:**
- Highlights the minimum element found in each iteration.
- Visualizes the swapping process.

#### Insertion Sort
- **Description:** Constructs a sorted subarray one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Visualization:**
- Highlights the element being inserted.
- Shows how elements shift to accommodate the new element.

#### Merge Sort
- **Description:** Recursively divides the array into halves and merges sorted subarrays.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

**Visualization:**
- Highlights subarrays during the division process.
- Animates the merging of sorted subarrays.

#### Quick Sort
- **Description:** Uses a pivot to partition the array into elements smaller and larger than the pivot, sorting them recursively.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) on average; O(n^2) in the worst case
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n)

**Visualization:**
- Highlights the pivot and partitions.
- Shows the rearrangement of elements around the pivot.

#### Queues (FIFO)
- **Description:** Implements enqueue and dequeue operations following the First-In, First-Out principle.
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) per operation
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

**Visualization:**
- Shows elements moving through the queue with visual indications of front and rear positions.

#### Linked Lists
- **Description:** Consists of nodes connected via pointers, supporting insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) for search; O(1) for insertion/deletion at the head
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

**Visualization:**
- Displays nodes as boxes connected by arrows, animating pointer changes during insertion or deletion.

- **Space Complexity:** O(V)

**Visualization:**
- Animates the step-by-step execution of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
- Highlights the pathfinding process.

**Interaction:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity:** O(V) (due to recursion or stack usage)

**Visualization:**
- Highlights nodes and edges in the order of traversal.

**Interaction:**
- Users select the starting node.
